# Our Story

Alyssa and Vincent were introduced by mutual friends in 2006 at a school play and realized that love at first sight really does exist even if you're only 15.

# Our Proposal

Vincent came up to Albany to help Alyssa move May 28th, 2016. That same weekend they decided to take a hike on Prospect Mountain where Vincent proposed at a scenic overlook of Lake George. A crowd of onlookers cheered, a dog ran around, and Alyssa tried to get over her shock.
